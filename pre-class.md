Prior to the workshop, participants are expected to install the software below. Prior experience using command line programs and something like R can be helpful but is not necessary for participation. Material will be delivered at an introductory level and attempt to get everyone up and running with a range of tools.

Instructors will hold an office hour on July 22nd from 17:00 to 18:00 (in person at the Boise Center) to help troubleshoot any problems in advance.


## Some common prerequisites

If you do not already, please install the following:

- install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- install a text editor for editing or writing code if you do not already have one. I strongly suggest VSCode:
    - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for all systems but with some extra features for coding
- install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	- there are now many ways to install Python and its associated package managers. If this is your first time installing Python, my honest opinion is that you want to install the version distributed through [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html). This will not only get Python in the right place for you, but a lot of packages that many other Python packages are dependent on. It is not as important for the exercises here, but might be more efficient for you in the long run.
