All students will adhere to the [code of conduct](https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-05-code-of-student-conduct/) developed by NCSU, which pertains to both academic and non-academic misconduct. Students will also commit to in-person participation for both lectures and labs. Becuase of the nature of labs sometimes requiring collecting and preparation of live specimens, missed labs cannot be repeated. Active participation and discussion is also expected during lectures. All discussion and questions will take place in good faith with a positive and supportive environment.
