## Learning Goals

* Develop conceptual understanding of processes underlying plant speciation
* Approach plant evolutionary biology from a phylogenetic framework
* Become familiar with mechanisms underlying plant genome evolution
* Identify key innovations in plant evolution with respect to diversification or human interactions
* Critically analyses literature in plant evolutionary biology from systematics to multi-omics
* Appreciate plant diversity


## Learning Outcomes

* Recognize major plant lineages and their diagnostic characters in a phylogenetic context
* Use taxonomic literature and databases to identify plants with a technical botanical vocabulary
* Be adept at plant dissections and generating research-grade morphometric data
* Be capable of critically reading plant evolution literature to support a wide range of use cases
* Design research that uses evolutionary (comparative) methods to elucidate the genetic basis of traits
* Communicate plant biology and evolution effectively to a technical audience
* Graduate students and undergrads will write significant portions of introductions needed for their respective theses
