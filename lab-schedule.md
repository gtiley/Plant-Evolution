The lab meets one a week from 12:50-15:50 on Fridays. Students should be prepared to take many pictures in the lab. There will be two near-campus field trips that replace the combined lecutre and lab from 10:40-15:50 on select days. Some scientific software should be installed on personal computers in advance to use the time effectively, with instructions posted [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pre-class). Otherwise, some desktop workstations will be available to help with software-dependant assignments.

## Grading

| Assignment | Points | Dates |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Practical 1     | 100    | 21 February |
| Practical 2     | 100    | 25 April    |
| Lab Reports  | 100     | 10 February |
| Collections   | 200     | 17 March    |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Total      | 500    |             |


You will be expected to ID and prepare 20 plant specimens with labels and high-quality metadata. Each specimen is worth 10 points each. This will likely invovle collecting more than 20 specimens, then editing down to the best or easiest ones.
