## Class Text

There is one official text book for the class that most readings will come from, *Plant Systematics*. Copies have been placed on hold in the library in lieu of having a personal copy.

* Simpson MG. 2019. Plant Systematics. 3rd Edition. Academic Press. London, UK.

Why *Plant Systematics*? There are several excellent text books in the field, with references to some provided below. I like this specific text because it is written using the **W-H-Y** (What-How-Why) method. Our typical class will start from an organismal and empirical perspective (the What), then discuss how research has been done to reveal fundamental concepts about why plants are fantastically diverse and the mechnisms by which we observe their species, trait, and molecular diversity.

## Additional Texts

Some other books are available in the library and in the Tiley lab for day use that might be helpful. They tend to provide a bit more phylogenetic or taxonomic perspecitives, respectively.

* Judd et al. 2015. Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach. 4th Edition Sinaur Associates. Sunderland, MA.
* Woodland D. 2009. Contemporary Plant Systematics. 4th Edition. Andrews University Press. Berrien Springs, MI.

## Plant Identification and Preparation Resources

These will be made available for use throughout the lab sessions and available for loan outside of the lab. Additional literature is available through the herbarium. A professional botanist in North Carolina might consider having a cheap used copy of *Plant Identification Terminology: An Illustrated Glossary*  on hand.

* Harris JG, Harris MW. 2001. Plant Identification Terminology: An Illustrated Glossary. Spring Lake Pub.
* Pell SK, Angell B. 2016. A Botanist's Vocabulary: 1300 Terms Explained and Illustrated. Timber Press. Portland, OR.
* Ronse De Craene LP. 2010. Floral Diagrams: An Aid to Understanding Flower Morphology and Evolution. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, UK.
* Castner JL. 2005. Photographic Atlas of Botany and Guide to Plant Identification. Feline Press. Gainesville, FL.
* Bramley GLC et al. 2023. The Kew Temperate Plant Families Identification Handbook. Kew Publishing. Richmond, UK.
* Utteridge TMA, Bramley GLC. 2016. The Kew Tropical Plant Families Identification Handbook. Kew Publishing. Richmond, UK. 
* Davies NMJ et al. 2023. The Herbarium Handbook: Sharing best practice from across the globe. Kew Publishing. Richmond, UK.

## Floras

The only flora used in this class will be Alan Weakley's *Flora of the southeastern United States*. This is to avoid confusion arising from different key formats among floras and because labs will focus on local flora. It is freely available in its entirety as a pdf, which I encourage all to obtain a copy. To avoid endless scrolling through a pdf during class time, relevant printed sections will be provided for labs.

* Weakley AS. 2023. Flora of the southeastern United States. North Carolina Herbairum, North Carolina Botanical Garden. Chapel Hill, NC.
