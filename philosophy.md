I believe that science is for **everyone**. It is my responsibility to develop training and foster a positive environment that helps anybody translate rigorous work into real-world impact. I believe that embracing uncertainty and making, at times, difficult decisions in light of that uncertainty is a crucial aspect of science beyond the classroom. Thus, I will not make oversimplifications regarding contentious topics and expects students to develop evidence-based positions from data and primary literature. I owe it to students to include rapidly changing technology in the classroom that builds relevant marketable skills, but learning outcomes will build off of a well-rounded conceptual basis for the field. Effective education in plant biology will ultimately lead to deeper and more enjoyable connections with nature that can last a lifetime and be shared with others.
